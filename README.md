## Overview
This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on environmental pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO using **Linear Regression**.  
It demonstrates how Machine Learning can automate environmental monitoring and decision-making processes.


## Workflow
1. Generate a small sample dataset (simulated AQI data).  
2. Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.  
3. Evaluate model performance (MAE, R²).  
4. Predict AQI for new input values.  
5. Save the trained model for reuse in automated workflows.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Joblib

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
